I have found the ABBY Finereader to be the worst thing I have ever used in my entire life.
You think you take a great picture but it always ends up terrible.
The license ends when you still have work to do and if you didn't pay attention to how to fix your bascially screwed.
The worst thing is no matter what it's always a headache.  
I literally have spent hours upon hours just copying and pasting onto atom.
The translation never ends up being what it says.
